This project was developed during 2009-2010 as an attempt to create a full fledged ERP aimed at automating various processes in an university, from student admission, credits and attendance management, Staff and student record keeping and report generation. Primary aim was to learn web development on LAMP stack and saving some bucks for the university by replacing half functional ERP sold by some company.
